    description: "Years ago, the Haight-Ashbury of San Francisco scene had a long-gone '60s and ‘70s hippie culture.  However, over time the Haight has changed.  But save for a few hippie memorabilia, today the Haight has a whole new vibe.  Although there are some fragments of flower-power, incense-burning, acid-dropping, peace-and-love-vibing era that can be purchased at smoke shops along the neighborhood, today the neighborhood is different. With exclusive boutiques, high-end vintage-clothing shops, second-hand stores, Internet cafés and hip restaurants having all settled in, this reinvented area stands out as one of San Francisco's commercial centers.  \r\n" +

      'What makes the Haight unique is its just-rolled-out-of-bed vibe during the day, which provides a perfect opportunity for lazing around in cafés and bookstores.  Weekends can get quite crowded with shoppers and brunch seekers during the day and club-goers at night. Neo-punks, club kids, fashionistas, tourists and neighborhood locals also fit in here, whether they have come to get a new piercing, grab a burrito or just enjoy some fun people-watching from a café.  But there are two distinct areas of the Haight: The Upper Haight, which stretches from Stanyan to Masonic, which is known as the shopping zone, though it deteriorates a bit where it stretches toward Golden Gate Park. While, the Lower Haight, roughly Divisidero to Webster is a more diverse neighborhood with a stony feel. While it has been an alternate nightlife hub for years, the Lower Haight has become a main attraction for DJs and ravers with an attraction to dance-music and clubs.',
